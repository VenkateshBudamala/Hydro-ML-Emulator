# ðŸŒŠ **Hydro-ML Emulator**  
**Unifying Hydrologic and Hydraulic Models Using a Machine Learning-Based Emulator**  

---

## **ðŸ”‘ Overview**  

This project provides a **unified framework** to integrate and optimize hydrologic and hydraulic models using **machine learning**. It uses:  
- **XGBoost** to create an emulator.  
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for optimization.  

The framework simplifies the calibration and analysis of diverse models like **SWAT**, **RAVEN**, **SUMMA**, and **HEC-RAS**, improving efficiency and reducing computational time.

## **ðŸ“‹ Quick Start Guide**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hydro-ML-Emulator.git
cd Hydro-ML-Emulator
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Then run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Set Your Inputs**  
Update `Input_File.py` to define the parameters for your simulation (e.g., rainfall, flow rates, etc.).  
This is the only file you need to modify.  

### **4. Run the Emulator**  
Execute the main script:  
```bash
python Main_Setup.py
```
Or, press **F5** in your Python IDE.  

### **5. View Results**  
Simulation outputs, including logs and visualizations, are saved in the `outputs/` directory.
